## Bootstrap Gulp Zip File Package (Created by Anibal Cruz)

1.  Here is a package Cruz created for those of you who want to work in bootstrap 4 and use its src SCSS files.  This package contains a Gulp process that works with bootstrap 4’s scss files and handles all the retooling it needs.  It will compile, auto-prefix, and minify the bootstrap.scss file into bootstrap.min.css which is in the public/css folder.

2. In order to use this process, you will have to have node installed.  If you do not, please follow the pre-work assignment on node installation. If you still have issues or want to try another routed Cruz placed instructions in the misc folder to install NVM without admin access. That installation will install nvm which allows you to specify which node version you want to run and also installs the node package manager (npm) which you will need to install dependencies.

3. To start using, drop the entire folder onto VSC and then open up the integrated terminal from the view option in the top tool bar then type into the terminal window: 

    `npm install` \\That will install all the dependencies the process needs.

4. Once you are back at the prompt, type: 

    `npm run dev`\\that will open up a browser at localhost:3000 and will be the address you will want to type into the other browsers if you want to have multiple browsers synced.

5. Remember, the scss files are in the scss folder and there is a file in there ready for your custom code: `_custom.scss`.  All your production files will live in the public folder.  You will not need to touch the css folder at all.   The index file has a bootstrap starter page built in.  It also uses placeholder images generated by js so you will have to remove the last js file on the page before pushing to production.
